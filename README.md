# sparknlp_OCR_and_NER_demo
A short demo showing how to download, OCR, and perform Named Entity Recognition on PDF documents from the web using Spark-nlp

We will use Spark NLP to perform OCR and then NER (named entity extraction) on public PDF documents pulled from the web. 
In particular - we will build a Spark NLP pipeline that processes a set of PDF documents, OCR's them and pull entities like person, location, and organization.
