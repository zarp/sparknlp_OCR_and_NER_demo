# sparknlp_OCR_and_NER_demo
A short demo showing how to download, OCR, and perform Named Entity Recognition on PDF documents from the web using Spark-nlp.

In particular - we will build a Spark NLP pipeline that processes a set of PDF documents, OCR's them and pull entities like person, location, and organization.
